# BookLand

## Overall Purpose
The overall objective of the project is to build a website for readers to share their thoughts on readings with others. Through this platform, readers can view various kinds of book lists made by other readers, create their own book lists, and make friends that have similar reading tastes.

## Main Features
### Regular User
* a basic user profile with a unique username, a signature (a short description of themselves), and a photo (the user's head portrait)
* make posts to share their opinions about books
* collect or like the posts
* customize multiple book lists regarding different demands, as well as a collection of their favorite posts

### Admin User
* all regular users' features
* manage the account status of regular users, including disabling and reactivating accounts
* add or remove books from the database and update book descriptions
* manage posts (specifically, delete the post)
